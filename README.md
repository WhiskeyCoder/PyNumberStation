# NumberStation
A python number station wrote for trolling a friend who loves Cryptography.
for 2 years until about a month ago, we used a blank Twitter profile and Twitch
to Stream a live feed that uses a Random genearted string and plays it like a 
Number station. They spent hours trying to decrypt the numbers lol, was very evil.

## Modified
this version was modified to allow you to just input any text and it will output it,
that can be easily modified out

## Usage
- Download the full repo
- install playsound via pip
- run numbersstation.py and it will ask you what you want to send you can give it anything inluding full URLs with specail characters
- The script will convert the input text to base64 and then started broadcasting it, Base64 will allow you to send Images/Files/Text/Links
- It will automatically start playing the numbers station and display the running message very 3 minutes
